# Datastructures and Algorithms

We are starting with the following sample problems.

## Problems
- Google sample - Find if a pair exists in an array
- Find is there are any common item in two arrays

## Data structures
Most of the times data structures are mostly prebuild. What is more important is to pick the right datastructures for the right
problem.
- Arrays (in case of C# use the inbuilt ArrayList or List<T>)
  - lookup O(1)
  - push O(1) // insert at end
  - insertAt O(n)
  - deleteAt O(n)
